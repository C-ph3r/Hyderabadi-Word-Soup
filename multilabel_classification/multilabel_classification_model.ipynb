We ordered Fries, panko mozzarella sticks, Tomato cream soup, panner65 & \"Italian\" Nachos. Not sure how that was nachos or italian. They basically bought a pack of dorittos and added mozarella cheese on top. The beans were not baked at all, and the entire dish was cold except for the plate that it was brought in. Pretty sure they just dumped the items and stashed it inside a microwave. The paneer 65 was horrendous. Might as well called it garlic 65 with no salt. Next was the mozarella sticks, which was again cold and no salt. The only decent item that we got was the fries and the soup. Thanks to gid we didnt order any main course. All these came up to 1300 and odd. Thanks to Zomato Gold, our price went down. This place is way too expensive for the quality of food they serve. And talking about the restaurant in general, the place looks decent but there are stoves stashed under tables and seats and plants kept at inconvenient spots. They really need to clean up more.\n",

For a non vegetarian prawns and all kinds chicken is a must try. For vegetarian chilly paneer, crispy corn, chilly fries. Here you can make your own pizza as well which helped us to gain some more space for the meal later. The Mediterranean pasta is better than the white one.

Even the 2 rating is because the staff was very polite and we had no complains there. Coming to the food: the sushi isn't good. The chef isn't aware that you don't give mayonnaise on sushi but wasabi. The starters were okay and we didn't repeat anything. In spite of being non vegetarians the only item we liked was the crispy corn. Then in aglio olio they used macaroni. The main course had a terrible array of dishes. And none was good. The biriyani had no chicken. The couscous salad had just quinoa and olives. The chocolate ice cream had an overdose of milk. All in all a very forgettable experience.

      "Here comes the big deal. Lets find out if all the craze that this place generates, is worth it? Actually four of us were there for the lunch and the waiter recommended \"Family Pack\" chicken Biriyani along with Reshmi Kebab and Ginger chicken for starters. The starters arrived and they looked yum! The Reshmi Kebab was wrapped in an fluffy wrapping (made with the non-yolk part of the egg) . The kebabs were so soft that it literally melted in our mouth. The ginger chicken was tasty as well. Must mention that both the starters had ample amount of chicken pieces, which was pretty filling for even four of us. Then came the \"Family Pack\" Biriyani, which was more than enough for even four of us( we even had to parcel the leftover). The Biriyani, here has a very different taste here. Its not that spicy but its delicious! No wonder, this place is so famous! Ratings - 4.5/5.\n",

We ordered 2 veg platters which were truck load filling. We couldn't eat anything more! Also ordered their apple cider beer and white high beer. Decent enough. Also wanted to try the moonlit one. But were sad to know that it wasn't available. Service was the best over all things said above! Mr Sarveshwar was quick to all our requests being made and had great suggestions to give! The sole reason why this review has a 4 rating instead of a 3 or 3.5. Only thing a lil lull about the experience was that they had stopped the music midway.

On my last trip to Goa, I had the opportunity to visit their outlet near Mobor beach(South Goa). I won't say that I had an awesome food experience, but I was blown away by their ambiance! Although they have opened an outlet in Hyderabad, for quite sometime , but somehow we were yet to visit. So on Sunday 19th May, 2019, it was time for redemption. We visited the place around at 8:30 pm in evening , and by just watching the sheer numbers of cars parked, I could figure out that it was a full house!\n",

They claim to offer healthy dishes and organic ingredients which look fantastic on the photos. Then you get regular oily fatty suspiciously-saucy Indian takeaway full of sugar and complex carbohydrates, probably from some nearby restaurant or street food stand. The only healthy thing about it was the size of the portion. No wonder it is low on calories: you can literally finish the whole plate in 4 bites. There were exactly 2 small chunks of chicken on it, maybe 25gr total, submerged in some ketchup based sweet sauce. I doubt it was even grilled. It looked and tasted more like it was fried, although with the disgusting oily sauce sugar coating it all who knows. The picture of the plate showed a full bowl of grilled chicken breast only, plus the sides on other plates. I should have taken a photo to show on this review and compare with the one on the menu but I was too hungry and mad to think about anything but eating the disappointing food. At least it wasn't too expensive, but definitely not healthy, not cheap, and not good quality food.\n",

Not just lunch and dinner they started catering snacks and breakfast as well making it easy to have healthy food at any point in a day.

They promise to deliver the food any time between 30- 40 mins to my location but its generally more than an hour. By the time food arrives, it's already cold which I hate personally. This happens mainly because they assign multiple deliveries and the other location would be too far from my location. The algorithm being used by Zomato is highly inefficient as of now and the customer care executives are helpless. Zomato needs to check this and also eat-fit management also should take some actions against Zomato.

      "\n",
      "They are serving IPL Live Screening with Bucket Bonanza where you can get 4 pints of Beer including a veg/non-veg starter. But you need to remember the Entry is restricted to adults, no kids allowed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, yesterday, I went to keep the invitation. It was around 6:15 pm and almost empty as the crowd starts after 8 pm anyday. I asked to serve their specialty, so they advised me to try thier special mocktail and cocktail. First, they served LSD, which is a kickoff cocktail, made with 5 types of liqueur, like Gin, Vodka, Tequila, Rum & Triple Sec. and made with freshly squeezed Orange juice. Triple sec is an orange flavored liqueur, made from the dried peels of bitter & sweet oranges. And with the use of Fresh Orange juice, the cocktail taste was so good and strong as well. I was eagerly waiting for the Mocktail. Thought of trying the non-alcohol drink first, then the cocktail. The mocktail was served along with Chicken Taco.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mocktail was made with Fresh Kiwi & Mint. The flavor of fresh ingredients were significant, made the drink so refreshing. Usually in bars, they use the syrup but here they use the fresh ingredients which made their drinks really nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "After that I tried their Chicken Taco. Those Tacos were made for Indians, so you can't get the blunt taste, but the real fusion works here. Those Tacos were stuffed with Indian spiced grilled Chicken and topped with mint raita and served in Malabar Ghee fried Parotas. Taste wise they were so good, but the only thing which bothered me, the Malabar Parota. As the parotas have layers, so it was difficult to hold the entire thing. so, I suggested to use plain Wheat Four/Maida Tortillas, I believe the taste will also go better with the Indian spiced Grilled Chicken. And yes, the Tacos were too filling, I could have only 2 of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now it's time for the Cocktail, which was literally inviting me to taste it. And believe me it was kicking off,so strong, but nice Orange flavored & very refreshing. I could only finish the 3/4th of the entire portion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stuff were insisting me to try something else on food. I left it on them, so they suggested me to try their signature dish Chicken Sambousek, what is that? That is Baharat Spiced Chicken Keema cooked & folded in spring roll sheet and then deep fried. Served with 3 types of dip, Mayo, Mint raita & Sweet Tamarind & saffron chutney. I liked to try these Sambousek with sweet Tamarind chutney, it went so well together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now you might be wondering what Baharat spice is? As per the Chef, the word baharat actually means \"spices\" in Arabic and not a single spice, but a blend of several spices. In this blend you can find black pepper, coriander, paprika, cardamom, nutmeg, cumin, cloves, and cinnamon. So, the chicken keema was cooked with these spices. Though the Sombousek looks pretty similar with Samosa, but the taste was very different. And that's why the 3 different types of dips were served.\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt the food quality & quantity is quite enough & satisfactory as per price. Definetly overall 4.5 out of 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "Already written about the ambiance : 5 out of 5\n",

      "I ordered for 🍅🍸 Blood Diamond Bloody Mary to start with which was different when they added Dijon Mustard. You can taste the mustard twist and smell the coriander leaves in the cocktail. The bartender brought the ingredients in test tubes, mixed it all up on the table and shook it just before serving. My next cocktail was Thyme of Your Life, well that had quite an interesting presentation with dry ice. Now, this drink actually gives you a kick 🙃😜🤪 in first sip itself. The 🍑 🍸 peach and vanilla flavours makes it refreshing but the thyme gives the twist in the taste. I would definitely recommend this beautifully presented drink. Coming on to the food- after going through the menu for a long time I finally ordered the Indianised version of Pasta- Fusili in Kasuri Methi and Coriander sauce. The name seemed to be different and you get a very light aroma of methi and coriander seeds being infused in the cream sauce. It was full of medium size diced veggies like- Zucchini, bell peppers, broccoli and 🍄 mushroom and sprinkled with very finely chopped coriander served with 2 slices of garlic bread 🍞 😋.\n",

The grill was replaced and hot starters were served so the point of the grill was totally made redundant. As soon as we pointed out that the service was slow and the starters weren't coming quickly, we dint know what we were calling for. The waiters visited our table every 2-3 mins to enquire if everything is alright now. I am not exaggerating when I say that they came to me at least 20-25 times in the next one hour to let them know that they are doing good. I did not dare to say that they weren't still good with the service and starters we were asking were not coming. They almost forced us to say they were excellent as apparently the rating for them was important even if it meant disturbing us every odd minute and spoiling the whole meal. Finally I was forced to give them an excellent rating as the man stood next to me till I did that. Feedback is to improve and not to be used as a tool torture. The food was nevertheless mediocre except the mutton sheek kabab and chicken pepper soup which was good. Barbeque nation, please don't pay your folks based on our ratings if you are doing that coz it's extremely irritating being answerable every minute.

When you have already been to the place and have a nice set of expectations from the food. First of all, the presence of foreign particles in food questions the level of hygiene inside the kitchen. I was probably too lucky that day to have two such instances. I politely asked to replace the drink that was served. But things got too much for me when I found a hair in the crispy corn. When I put this into light to the serving staff, they just tried to take away the plate and all I got to listen was they will replace it. That’s what drove me mad. When I demanded to see the manager, he apologized and asked for the plate replacement. But I was done with the food now. No more nonsense.

As we were six members they brought 2 barbeques. In the barbeque they served all types of non vegetarian and vegetarian food including prawns, chicken, fish mutton, paneer, potatoes, corns. We had lots of prawns and fish in the starter and had for at least 2 hours. After that, we moved towards the soup, they have only one non veg and one veg soup. We requested for hot and sour soup, so they prepared for us. In main course they served veg as well as non veg curries, Chinese and biryani.

      "₹269/-\n",
      "It was the most delicious Thali I ever had in life, just divine and out of the world ❤️❤️\n",
      "It comprises of the following:\n",
      "▪️Kadai Paneer (4.5/5)\n",
      "Paneer are usually always tasty in most of the restaurants but the gravy always lacks the taste!! I have the habit of just eating the paneer cubes and leaving the gravy!!! But, this one has the most tasty and delicious gravy👍👍\n",
      "\n",
      "▪️Dum aloo (4/5)\n",
      "This was the veg of the day, potatoes 🥔 were peeled properly and were marinated nicely!!! Just like paneer, the gravy was something to lure for!!\n",
      "\n",
      "▪️Dal Makhani (4.5/5)\n",
      "A Punjabi Thali is definitely incomplete without a Dal Makhani!!! It is one of the most popular and loved dal in the northern part of the country!! The dal gets its taste and richness from the use of cream and butter in black lentils and red kidney beans!! It was super yummy and definitely the best dal makhani I ever had!!\n",
      "\n",
      "▪️Bundi Raita (5/5)\n",
      "This one stole my heart ❣ I think words won’t do justice for its great taste!! I never had such a tasty raita ever in any restaurant and trust me I eat out a lot!!! I would have mind having 3 bowls of raita at one go coz it was this yummy!! The curd was fresh and the minimum spices used in it was adding the perfect flavour... A big thumbs up for this dish 👍👍👍\n",
      "\n",
      "▪️Rice (4/5)\n",
      "The zeera basmati rice 🍚 was definitely of the best quality!! It was big in size and was cooked so well!! Each rice piece was looking like a gem on its own !!!\n",
      "\n",
      "▪️Butter Tandoori Roti (4/5)\n",
      "It was soft, buttery and definitely only made up of wheat 🌾 without any hint of maida!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "▪️Salad (4.5/5)\n",
      "Fresh cucumber 🥒, carrot 🥕 and onion with a pinch of lemon 🍋 is definitely makes the best salad in a Punjabi Thali 👍👍\n",
      "\n",
      "▪️Kheer (4/5)\n",
      "The perfect way to end a meal is by having a sweet dish and what can be better than kheer!!! It was not overly sweet but the sugar was mixed in a way that will suit everyone!!!\n",
      ".\n",
      ".\n",
      "⚫️ The service was quick and they did not made us wait for more than 15 mins!!! What I like most about the food was that the spices was added in a perfect way, just to make it tasty they have not turned it into super spicy!!!\n",
      "The quantity is good for one person although even two person can share it!!! But, I will suggest not to share as it is so yummy and tasty, you will regret sharing even a single bite!!\n",

I have had the Blackened salmon steak, Cilantro Fish and the Murrel Crust and have loved each one. However, if I had to pick one it would be the Salmon and that too would win by a very close margin.

      "\n",
      "It was Wednesday night and we were near Gachibowli and really hungry, when I suggested we will visit Jonathan's Kitchen, it is my favorite place to hangout. I was with my five friends and we started our dinner with their special starters Grilled Pomfret, Chili chicken , Crispy Corn , Chicken Wings, Nawabi shikampuri kebab, Dragon prawns and Tiger prawns. All of the starters were the best, I have never tried such before anywhere. Now that the starting was the best, I promise at the end it will be a blast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grilled pomfret was tasty and soft to bite, it was properly cooked with perfect spices and we ordered this twice. It was so good! Chili chicken wasn’t much spicy, it was well equitable of spices and the best starter to start our dinner. Crispy corn I have tried at many restaurants and I loved Flechazo’s before, but now I can say the best crispy corn is at Jonathan's kitchen. I think this is the best compliment. Chicken wings for this just one word magnificent!\n",
      "\n",
      "Then my favorite part were the prawns. Here we tried 3 different types of prawns, Butter Garlic prawns; this is just out of the world first time we have tried this really the taste is unforgettable, Dragon prawns; one of my friends suggested me to try this here, Mr. Tarak, the name itself represents dragon prawns. It is the best in prawns compared to tiger prawns, Tiger prawns; these were too large in size, I have never seen the size of prawns like tiger prawns taste also too good it was the best to end our starters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we ordered some mocktails because it’s mandatory; Orange delight ,Cucumber n mint, Virgin pina colada ,Black current, Spicy tango and Blue lagoon or blue heaven. Every mocktail has their own specialty. Orange delight and cucumber n mint were the winners of the evening. Black current is really good in taste and refreshing. Spicy tango and blue lagoon were the ultimate mocktails. Every mocktail is best at Jonathan's kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then it’s time for main course, in that we ordered Dal Tadka and Rara Gosht with Butter naan and Amritsari Kulcha, and Burnt Fried Rice with Schezwan Chicken Gravy. Every dish just left us speechless! Dal tadka and rara gosht tasted absolutely great with butter naan and Amritsari Kulcha. Burnt Fried Rice with Schezwan Chicken Gravy was the ultimate dishe to end our phenomenal dinner at Jonathan's kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "But without dessert, I never end my dinner. So here we ordered Gulab jamun, Chocolate fondant cake with vanilla ice cream and Cream brulee with Fresh fruits. All the desserts are just marvelous to end our dinner.\n",

The luxurious ambiance and enchanting music make this place an ensemble of various occasions. I was here for a Tuesday night dinner with some friends and we experienced a flavorful time.\n",
      "\n",
      "We started off with some amazing starters; Butter Garlic Prawns, Grilled Pomfret, Dragon Prawns, Crispy Corn Pepper Salt, Chicken Wonton and Nawabi Shikampuri Kebab. The Prawns were just fabulous, they were a perfect start to our dinner. Grilled Pomfret was also very good. Crispy Corn were the best that I've ever had, they've topped my last best opinion. Chicken Wonton had a perfect crisp covering and the filling was really great. Lastly, the Nawabi Shikampuri Kebab were very juicy and succulent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next we had some of the finest mocktails; Orange delight, Cucumber n mint, Virgin pina colada, Black currant, Spicy tango and Blue lagoon or blue heaven. All of these were very refreshing and perfect to have before moving onto the main course, while still enjoying the appetizers. Although Virgin Pina Colada wasn't that great, and Orange Delight the best.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had an array of dishes from the main course, starting off with the ambrosial Chateaubriand, tenderloin cooked medium rare and served with creamy spinach and mushroom cream. It is a high end dish, and it did keep it's name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we savored Rara Gosht and Dal Tadka curries with Butter Naan and Amritsari Kulcha. Both curries were absolutely delectable and were a divine treat to our taste buds. Lastly, we had Fried Rice with Schezwan Chicken Gravy. This was an absolute favourite of all, a tempting and toothsome Chinese dish with succulent chicken crispy on the outside juicy inside, slathered with a hot sweet uniquely spicy and sticky Indo Chinese schezwan sauce that just made our night.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ended our dinner with the most sumptuous desserts; a classic Gulab Jamun, a fruity Creme Brulee, and a luscious Chocolate Fondant Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream. A perfect end to an amazing dinner. We had a wonderful time here and are just waiting to visit again.\n",

      ">> worst service I ever experienced. If we order an item no one take responsibility to bring it. They will stay at the corner and chit chat each other. There was a lady I said ur servicing was very worst and smiled in sarcastic way and went off. They will replace items after 20min. We have to wait for that item. Even bowls for sweets they will bring after half an hour that too not more than 5. At last I feed up with the services and had thought to have sweet and I find an Cockroache in the bowl I called the lady and waiter they did not responded. Then I went to kitchen and called a person ranjith he took the bowl and went inside the kitchen and came back and said sorry and offered 5 Ice creams. We were around 30 people. And he saying to come in the evng or next day. I don't know what they think about the customers. Basically it looks like decent and star hotel but the people and the service just like irani cafe. At least in cafe if we order they will get it fast or else inform us if it late. I heard lot about Jonathan kitchen food is absolutely good. But the people their behaviour and neatness was very very bad. Kindly find the attachment. Thank you and I never visit u.\n",

I was among the two who went for à la carte. For the sunday brunch there was a live performance by a band. The ambience was buzzing as the restaurant was quite crowded, they offer open air seating as well. The starters of the the brunch are placed in the open air section and the other courses are placed indoor. Personally, I felt the seating isn't much comfortable as the chairs' backrest lacked comfort. The air conditioning was not great as the temperature inside wasn't as comfortable as I expected it to be. However, the service by the staff is impeccable they help in every way they can.\n",
      "Coming to the food, I had ordered Mutton Sukha, Rib eye steak and grilled tiger prawns. My companions went for the sunday brunch, as they told me the non-vegetarian starters were all wonderful except for the fish tawa fry which was not boneless. All the starters were very well balanced in flavour, the chicken kalmi kabab was exquisite. Compared to the starters, the main course was not so great the curries lacked texture and were not so great but the yellow dal was very soothing. Prawn cocktail was outstanding, the desserts were all very good and not extra sweet. Coming to the à la carte menu, the Mutton Sukha was great in every way, the spices were perfectly balanced they weren't overpowering the flavour of the meat, it's definitely a must try there. The rib eye steak didn't impress me much, the meat wasn't juicy as it is supposed to be and that was disappointing. On the other hand, the grilled tiger prawns were brilliant, they were served on a bed of sautéd spinach with garlic which was good too and prawns were boosting with flavour.\n",

      "Moving forward I’d like to talk about the mutabak, the chef had taken pedantic efforts to make this dish as authentic as it could get, I’d have to give him brownie points for his painstaking ability to make this dish, the omelet was perfectly cooked and not crisp like the replicas of mutabak that are available in other so called Mediterranean restaurants. The carbonara was perfectly cooked, in the Italian way, the black pepper that stuck on each piece of pasta just showed how well versed the chef was with this recipe.\n",

I remember reading that it was one of the really sought out places for Japanese cuisine once but now has almost everything available. In any case, I ordered a stater (shanghai rolls) which was average and finally went ahead and ordered Sushi for myself & wife and a pizza for my daughter. The sushi was good but not as good as the one I had tried at Mamagoto (my fav place for asian cuisine). The pizza was better than the sushi but still would not say at par with some of the other authentic Italian restaurants in the city. I also tried their creme brulee (best of the lot) which was really nice except for the tangy fruits that they put as a topping. In my opinion, they ought to get rid of those toppings and keep it simple as it was quite delicious by itself. I would have rated it 3.5 but for their really slow service (and zomato has for some reason gotten rid of decimal ratings). \n",
